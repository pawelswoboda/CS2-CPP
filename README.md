** Summary **

This is a port of the famous cost scaling algorithm for minimum cost flow.
For a detailed description, see:
A.V. Goldberg, "An Efficient Implementation of a Scaling Minimum-Cost 
Flow Algorithm", Journal of Algorithms, vol. 22, pp. 1-29, 1997.

CS2 was developed by Andrew Goldberg (goldberg@intertrust.com) and
Boris Cherkassky (cher@cher.msk.su).
